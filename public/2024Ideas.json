In my experience it has been difficult to understand the language as well as make friends that help you improve and practice it, so a good way to overcome that barrier is with the existence of reading clubs where one can learn the language as well as create friendships in the process.",
    "solution": "Generally, reading clubs are designed for people with advanced English, so it is difficult to find one where you can just practice, regardless of your level of English. If there was a club that helped overcome this barrier, it would not only be helping people improve with English but it would also be creating a network of reading community and possible friends among the same community.",

(3)  Library:  Many areas don't have a lot of reading / library spaces to get books, to learn, study, or have a quiet space to read in.  Having libraries in schools and in our community bring kids and adults to have the benefits listed above.  (4) Food - A lot of the food in school is disgusting and many kids don't like the schedule of healthy fridays.  A solution is putting greens on the side of the trays unlike putting them in the foods.  Ex:  Greens in Burgers.  Doesn't look or taste good.

There can also be inseative for kids who struggle with things. like if you struggle with listening in school if you go a certain amount of days without getting into trouble, you could get free food in the food court. there should also be a food court with popular food chains. so kids know they like it. There could also be a lounge area wit laptops, phones charger, pens, pencils tables anything you  could need for h.w. this is a great afterive to biking in the roads and for the winter when its to cold to ride also this place could have a trace out back you can access from the inside of the building. so know one can escape. free lockers should be included to store your stuff. some days and times should be detedrate to younger kids and other days to older kids worried should also be able to help with H W",

    "challenge": "seniors and adults who have been given permission to ride public service half price still have to pay full price for car service = too expensive for fixed incomes",
    "solution": "as we already have in MTA, approved individuals should be able to ride car services for 1/2 price. Half paid on persons choice card (unclear if that's what this says) and city / organizations pays the other half -- prioritizing support for yellow cabs. \n\nFacilitator note: one things this doesn't mention is that seniors find Access-a-ride very unreliable and need to still use car service as back-up option and need to pay full price. By having a program where we support people with disabilities and older adults get to their health appointments and to get around the city (such as grocery shopping), this would make a sizable impact on many people throughout the borough. I have personally seen this concept to be very successful in other parts of the country (ex: in South Bend, Indiana, the City helped a nonprofit organization to partner with Lyft to provide rides to work for high-risk individuals prone to being laid off for being late to work. this idea has won many awards in the \"civic innovation\" space). Please contact Sara Boukdad (CEC Facilitator for this session) at 857-544-0934 if I can provide more context.",
